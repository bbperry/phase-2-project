Childrens Bookshelf

This app is designed for special ed teachers that see many different children per week with different needs. Childrens books are commonly used to work on issues individual students have. With so many children books in the teachers collection, it can be hard to remember what they can be used for. Childrens Bookshelf holds a collection of books that are categorized by what issues they can target. It can help users remember what books are good for what purpose. The user can search for a book based by title and filter by pre-set categories. They can add books to "Todays Lesson" to organize the chosen books for the day. The user can add notes if they find another use for a specific book. (Future versions will also be able to search for added notes.) The user can also add and remove books from the library.
